# [box-shadow](https://nicotakenotice.github.io/box-shadow/)
Sandbox tool to play with the homonymous CSS property.

## Development server
Install the dependencies and run a dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [`localhost:4300`](http://localhost:4300). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from `localhost`. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` command in `package.json` to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
